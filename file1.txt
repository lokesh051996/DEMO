hello hi

Should you encounter other problems, please first search the bug tracker (
also look at the closed issues)
and the mailing list, chances are that the problem was reported already. 
Also make sure that you use an up to date Git for Windows version 
(or a current snapshot build). If it has not been reported, 
please follow our bug reporting guidelines and report the bug
